!         and y projected lengths with "hypot" and then sum them up in the

!         Use the exit temperature, density and velocity calculated for the

!         INSERT

!         Set a limit to the maximum allowable mach number in the initial
!         guess, call this "mach_lim", calculate the corresponding temperature,
!         called "t_lim"
!         INSERT

!         Now estimate the velocity and density at every "i = const" line, call 
!         the velocity "v_guess(i)" and the density "ro_guess(i)":
!             1. Assume density is constant at the exit value
!             2. Use continuity and "l_i(i)" to estimate the velocity
!             3. Assume stagnation temperature is constant for static temp
!             4. Limit the static temperature, lookup intrinsic "max"
!             5. Calculate the density throughout "ro_guess(i)"
!             6. Update the estimate of the velocity "v_guess(i)" 
!         INSERT

!         Direct the calculated velocity to be parallel to the "j = const"
!         gridlines for all values of i and j. This can be achieved with a 
!         similar calculation to the "j = nj/2" one that was performed in the 
!         crude guess. Then set all of ro, roe, rovx and rovy, note that roe 
!         includes the kinetic energy component of the internal energy.
!         INSERT
