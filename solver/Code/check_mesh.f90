!     Check the cell area and facet length calculations before attempting to
!     solve the flow, make sure you do this for both the "bump" and "bend" test
!     cases

!     Explicitly declare the required variables
      use types
      implicit none
      type(t_grid), intent(inout) :: g
      real :: area_min, dx_error, dy_error, tol
      integer :: ni, nj

!     Get the size of the mesh and store locally for convenience
      ni = g%ni; nj = g%nj;

!     Exact checking of floating point numbers never goes well, define a
!     small tolerance to use for a comparative operation instead
      tol = 1e-4 * g%l_min

!     Check that all of the cell areas are positive, either with the intrinsic
!     "minval" function or with nested do loops. Print the output to the screen
!     and flag negative numbers as an error with an if statement to "stop" the
!     program
!     INSERT

!     Next check that the sum of the edge vectors around every quadrilateral is 
!     very nearly zero in both the x and y-coordinate directions. You can
!     complete this with some elementwise addition of the arrays and use of the
!     "maxval" and "abs" intrinsic functions.
!     INSERT

!     It may be worthwhile to complete some other checks, the prevous call to
!     the "write_output" subroutine has written a file that you can read and
!     postprocess using the Python script plot_mesh.py. This program also has
!     access to all of the mesh parameters used within the solver that you could
!     inspect graphically.

!     Print a blank line
      write(6,*)

      end subroutine check_mesh
